![Installing 7-Zip Through Electric](https://github.com/electric-package-manager/electric/blob/master/assets/install-animation.gif?raw=true)

Highly optimized for **speed** and **usability**, Electric is anywhere from 200% to 1500% faster than other market competitors for downloading Applications and Packages, and has incredible speeds for concurrent / parallel downloading.

Electric believes in incredible **efficiency**, and is the only Windows package manager that officially supports installing packages **concurrently**.

Built for today's systems and with good support for lower specced systems, Electric runs smoothly even on systems with as little as 2 GB of ram!

**Note**: Since electric is in an alpha phase, it might not be completely stable yet. Feel free to open any issues or bug reports at [issues](https://github.com/electric-package-manager/electric/issues/).

#### Tab Completion
When using the official Electric installer, tab completion is setup for you out of the box, however, it is possible to manually add tab completion for electric.
Add the below lines to your powershell profile:
```powershell
Register-ArgumentCompleter -Native -CommandName electric -ScriptBlock {
    param($wordToComplete, $commandAst, $cursorPosition)
    [Console]::InputEncoding = [Console]::OutputEncoding = $OutputEncoding = [System.Text.Utf8Encoding]::new()
    $Local:word = $wordToComplete.Replace('"', '""')
    $Local:ast = $commandAst.ToString().Replace('"', '""')
    electric complete --word="$Local:word" --commandline "$Local:ast" --position $cursorPosition | ForEach-Object {
        [System.Management.Automation.CompletionResult]::new($_, $_, 'ParameterValue', $_)
    }
}
```
Then, restart your powershell and you've setup tab completion!
